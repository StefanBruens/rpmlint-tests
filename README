rpmlint test suite.

You need to install rpmlint-Factory to run the tests locally. You
may "rpm -e --nodeps rpmlint-mint" and install rpmlint instead if
you need to adjust rpmlint files. The test suite works with both
rpmlint and rpmlint-mini.

each tests consists of several files in tests/:

name.spec:	the spec file. It must produce an rpm of the same name.
name.ref:       reference rpmlint output
name.ignore:	rpmlintrc to ignore unrelated errors (optional)
name.env:       extra environment variables (optional)

to run all tests just call "./run" or "make test", to run a single
test call "./run tests/name.spec"
The script runs rpmbuild on all spec files and then rpmlint on the
resulting rpms. A test succeeds if the output matches the reference
output.

To create a new test called 'name' case run "./newtest name"
